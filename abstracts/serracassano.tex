\mytitle{Sobolev regularity of flows  associated to vector fields with exponential or sub-exponential summability}
\begin{myabstract}
We are concerned with the Sobolev regularity of a flow 
$X:\,I\times I\times \Omega\to\Omega$ 
associated to a non-smooth vector field 
$b:\,I\times\Omega\to\Omega$, 
i.e. the solution of the Cauchy problem
\[
\begin{cases}
\partial_tX(t,s,x)&=\,b(t,X(t,s,x))\\
X(s,x)&=\,x
\end{cases}
\quad\,t,s\in I, \,x\in\Omega\,,
tag{P}
\]
where $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n\protect $ is a given open domain and $I\subset\mathbb R\protect $ is a  given  interval.
We are going  to discuss   assumptions on vector field 
$b$ in order that (P) is well-posed, that is, if it admits existence and uniqueness. Moreover we will focus  on the Sobolev regularity of the associated flow $X\protect $,    that is,  whether, for a given $p\ge\,1\protect $,   $X(t,s,\cdot)\in W_{loc}^{1,p}(\Omega_{(t,s)},\mathbb R^n)\protect $ for given $t,s\in I\protect $, where $\Omega_{(t,s)}\protect $ denotes the open set of $x\in\Omega\protect $ such that the path starting at $x\protect $ at time $s\protect $ can be extended until time $t$.  We will review some well-known results  in this topic and we will present some new results which  are part of a joint work with L. Ambrosio  and S. Nicolussi Golo (Jyväskylä). Eventually an application will be given to the Bernstein problem for area-minimizing intrinsic graphs in the sub-Riemannian first Heisenberg group, which is part of a joint work with S. Nicolussi Golo and Mattia Vedovato (Trento) still in progress.
