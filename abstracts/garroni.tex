\mytitle{Variational approach for grain boundaries}
\begin{myabstract}
The talk will focus on the role played by material defects in determination of the surface tension carried by grain boundaries in polycrystals. Defects induce elastic distortion in the bulk, therefore a variational model accounting for both, elastic energy and presence of defects, as the one proposed by Lauteri and Luckhaus, is the starting point for our analysis.
