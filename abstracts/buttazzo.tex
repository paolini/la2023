\mytitle{Antagonistic cost functionals in shape optimization}
\begin{myabstract}
In several shape optimization problems one has to deal with cost functionals of the form\\\relax
${\mathcal F}(\Omega)=F(\Omega)+kG(\Omega)$, where $F$ and $G$ are two shape functionals with a different monotonicity behavior and \protect $\Omega$ varies in the class of domains with prescribed measure. In particular, the cost functional \protect ${\mathcal F}(\Omega)$ is not monotone with respect to \protect $\Omega$ and the existence of an optimal domain in general may fail. An interesting situation occurs when the functional \protect $F(\Omega)$ is minimized by a ball, while the functional \protect $G(\Omega)$ is maximized by a ball; several examples of this kind are present in the literature. We consider the particular case \protect ${\mathcal F}(\Omega)=\lambda(\Omega)T^q(\Omega)$ where \protect $\lambda(\Omega)$ is the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian, and \protect $T(\Omega)$ is the so-called torsional rigidity; the interesting cases are \protect $q$ small for the minimum problem and \protect $q$ large for the maximum problem.
