\mytitle{Stable solutions to semilinear elliptic equations}
\begin{myabstract}
The regularity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic PDEs has been studied since the 1970's. It was initiated by a work of Crandall and Rabinowitz, motivated by the Gelfand problem in combustion theory. The theory experienced a revival in the mid-nineties after new progress made by Brezis and collaborators. I will present these developments, as well as a recent work, in collaboration with Figalli, Ros-Oton, and Serra, which finally establishes the regularity of stable solutions up to the optimal dimension 9. I will also describe a more recent paper of mine which provides full quantitative proofs of the regularity results.
