\mytitle{The Riemannian Penrose inequality 
\\via nonlinear potential theory}
\begin{myabstract}
I will discuss the Riemannian Penrose inequality 
in an asymptotically flat $3$-manifold with 
nonnegative scalar curvature, and the main points of 
a new proof by means of a monotonicity formula, 
holding along the level sets of the $p$-capacitary 
potentials of the horizon of a black hole.

Joint work with Francesca Oronzio.
