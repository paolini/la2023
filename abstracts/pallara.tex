\mytitle{Mean value formulas for degenerate parabolic equations}
\begin{myabstract}
I deal with mean value formulas for classical solutions of some degenerate parabolic equation with \protect $C^1$ coefficients, including degenerate Kolmogorov equations. The theory of functions of bounded variation and perimeters in stratified Lie groups is an essential tool in the proof.
