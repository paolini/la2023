\mytitle{Homogenisation of free discontinuity problems}
\begin{myabstract}
We study deterministic and stochastic homogenisation problems for free discontinuity functionals under hypotheses which lead to an interaction between surface and volume energies. The results are based on a compactness theorem with respect to Gamma-convergence, on the characterisation of the integrands of the Gamma-limit by means of limits of minimum values of some auxiliary minimum problems on small cubes, and on the subadditive ergodic theorem for the stochastic part.
