\mytitle{Min-Max construction of anisotropic minimal surfaces}
\begin{myabstract}
Since the seminal work of Birkhoff min max techniques have been a powerful tool in showing existence of stationary point of geometric variational problem. Almgren-Pitts developed in the 80`s extended the min-max framework to the area functional, to show existence of minimal surfaces. In this talk I will discuss the extension of the Almgren-Pitts theory to anisotropic energies. The lack of local area bounds requires to devise a new strategy to the regularity theory. This is a joint work with A. De Rosa.
